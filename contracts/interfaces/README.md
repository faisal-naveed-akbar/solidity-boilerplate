## Solidity Interfaces

The purpose of an interface is to enforce a defined set of properties and to execute specific functions in another object. These are used not only in the smart contracts to make sure a certain set of functionality is implemented, they are also very useful in writing tests. When the tests implement these interfaces, they enforce the implementing test to implement and test each and every function.
