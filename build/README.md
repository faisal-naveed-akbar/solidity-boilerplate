## Build

This folder contains the ABI's (Application Binary Interfaces) of all the solidity contracts. An ABI contains names of the functions in the contract that can be called and the data that they return. An Ethereum smart contract is bytecode deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. There could be several functions in a contract. An ABI is necessary so that you can specify which function in the contract to invoke, as well as get a guarantee that the function will return data in the format you are expecting.
